## Testing in a 10m x10m space

#### Test Venue
ZKM Kubus

#### Anchors
Anchors are placed on the back of 4 chairs. The website says, it's better to put them on the wall for the better result. However, the site also says, metallic objects should be not placed near to the achors. Unfortunetely, metallic pipes are exposed on the walls.

#### Placement
The follwoing diagram shows the placement of the anchors. The room covered is bigger than 100 squaremeters.

#### Tag

Tag requires a power (USB +5v), so I put both my laptop and pozyx on a cart and moved around in the space.

#### Sonification
With a simple max patch the position data is mapped to the frequency of  a sawtooth.

#### Sound Spots
I placed three virtual spots in the space and programmed to trigger three different sounds if the pozyx holder enters the circle.

#### With Lowpass
In order to avoid the erros, I applied simple lowpass to the position data. (Turn up the volume. The sound is too soft in the video.)
