This is an internal survey for ZKM developer who is interested in position tracking technology, using UWB (Ultra Wide Band).

- Pozyx is a DIY kit for Ultra Wide Band position tracker developed by a start-up located in Gent, Belgium. 
- They denotes that 3D position tracking with less than 10 cm deviation is possible with the system.
- It can be used with or without Arduino.
- The cost of pozyx is acceptable = 5 tags + 4 anchors = 1000 euros. this is extremely cheap compared to ubisense one.

The order number of my order was around 1500. If this number is the number of device they have already sold. presumably, the company is not very successful in terms of its business.
